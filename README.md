# SurveyParser
Turns Google Forms peer evaluation surveys into a gradebook-like spreadsheet with compiled (and averaged) peer evaluation scores.
The script is in Beta phase and still buggy.
## About
SurveyParser is a workflow plus Python script that was developed to quickly turn group project peer evaluation results generated using a Google Forms survey into a spreadsheet that compiles the evaluations (and summary statistics) for each student in a Canvas course. It was created after many semesters of nightmarish wrestling with compiling these data for large-enrollment general education courses. The goal was to streamline the process so that I could focus on providing feedback, not tracking down which evaluations paired to which students from hundreds of often incomplete and poorly-spelled evaluations. I hope it helps you more successfully implement group projects with fair, participation-based grading in your courses!
